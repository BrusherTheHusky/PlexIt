# PlexIt
Send videos to your Plex server.

Easily send videos to your Plex server. This add-on is built around the 'Plex It!' bookmarklet, which lets you save videos to your Watch Later playlist, recommend them to friends, or 'fling' them onto the big screen with your Plex Media Server, directly from your browser.
